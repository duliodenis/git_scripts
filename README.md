# Git Scripts
These are the Git scripts I use on my development environment to have Git autocomplete on the shell as well as the Git branch on the prompt.

*Three Steps to Get These Working*:

1. Copy the git_completion.bash script to your home directory (~)
2. Copy the .git_prompt.bash script to your home directory (~).
3. Copy .bash_profile to your home directory. If you already have a .bash_profile then add the lines in this script to your current .bash_profile to change the prompt and enable completion support.

Open a new shell, cd into a git repo, and enjoy the magic.
